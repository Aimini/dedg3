# dedg3
dedg3 with Qt
#about this project
This is a implementation of the web site 'www.dedg3.com' apperance by using c++ and Qt.
It's using Â `<QGraphicView>` and `<QGraphicItem>` to simulation this site's effect.
**Unfortunate, its efficiency is only slightly higher than the web page version.**
I think directly painting with OpenGL is a Better choice.
